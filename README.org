  * Displaying correct pixels
  * Input handling (except GET_KEY)
  * Correct arithmetic flags

* Building

Built using Hare 0.25.2 and SDL3 (using [[https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/][Drew DeVault's]] [[https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/hare-sdl3][bindings]]). As Hare does not officially support Windows or Mac, I can only confirm this building on Linux (personally on Fedora 42).
